## Reading strategies

### Pre-reading
* Title - What does the title tell you about the content of the book?
* Table of contents - What does the table of contents tell you about the structure of the book?
* Index - How extensively are your the people, places, or ideas, from your research topic covered in the book?

### Selective reading
* Read the introduction and conclusion first.
* Scan the index to find and read the pages/chapters relevant to your research topic.

### Para-reading
* Find 2-3 book reviews of the book in academic journals.
* What can you learn from the reviewer's evaluation of the book?
* What can you learn about the book's place in the wider scholarly conversation?

### In-depth reading
* Interrogate the text:
    * What claim is the author making?
    * What arguments are made to advance the claim?
    * What evidence is offered in support of the arguments?

* Use the BEAM model to think through the author's sources
    * Background sources
    * Exhibit sources
    * Argument sources
    * Method sources


## Note-taking strategies

### Reading notes

Focus on information relevant to your research topic.

Emphasize ideas over quotations.

Clearly distinguish between quotes, paraphrases, summaries, and your own thoughts.

### Research notes

"A thoughtful, judicious selection of material from your reading should be followed by a thoughtful, judicious selection from your own notes when the time comes to write" (Brundage, Going to the Source, 121).

Organize research notes by topic or theme rather than by source.

Research notes should be atomized to allow for multiple organizational schemes.

Use complete sentences for research notes.
